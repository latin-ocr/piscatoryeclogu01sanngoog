PREFACE

Tne favorable reception accorded to my edition of “ good
old Mantuan ’' has encouraged meto make a similar study
oi the much better eclogues of Sannazaro.

The text is based upon that of the first printed edition,

of Naples‚ 1526. The more important later variants are '

mentioned in the notes The spelling is modified to suit the
convenience of the modern reader. The punctuation is
my own. ,
Through the good offices of J. A. Hunorum, Esq., of the
British Museum, I had secured a ‘rotograph’ copy of the
Editio Princeps. And through a similar courtesy on the
part of Abbe PAuL Lrnsnnar, I am able to print Sannazaro’s

piscatory fragment as it stands in the Vatican ‘autograph '.

I hope that most of my obligations to earlier writers are
duly acknowledged in the footnotes. But there is one ex-
cellent book which seems to have been left for special men·

tion here: La Poesia Pastorale, by ENR1co CARRARA, Milan,
1909.
