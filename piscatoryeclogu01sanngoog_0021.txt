IN TRODUC TION

“ sarisas pascuum roo narnus Ar> cunas '’

In his Piscatory Eclogues Sannazaro proiessed to be
playing the part of a pioneer.13 Thus at iv. 17 he writes:

nunc litoream ne despice Musam
quam tibi post silvas, post horrida lustra Lycaei
(si quid id est) salsas deduxi primus ad undas,
ausus inexperta tentare pericula cymba

And in Eleg. iii. 2, 57-58 he has:

quandoquidem salsas descendi ego primus ad undas,
ausus inexpertis reddere verba sonis.

This claim ignores certain of the Idyls of Theocritus (vi,
xi„ xxi) an author whom Sannazaro knew very well. But it

wis allowed by his contemporaries, ior example hy Lodovico
Ariosto‚ O. F. xlvi. 17:

Iacobo Sanazar, ch' alle Camene
Lasciar fa i monti et abitar l'arene3

and Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus Epistola ad Antonium
Thebaideum:

et Syncerus abest, cecinit qui primus in acta
non prius auditum carmen, quo gurgite ab alto
prosiluit Triton simulet chorus Amphitrites.1⁴

And it has regularly been admitted by his later readers.

DATE OF THE LATIN ECLOGUES

They were first printed at Naples in 1526. Paulus Jovius
speaks of them as youthful compositions: “illae quae iuveni
exciderant Piscatoriae Eclogae ’11⁶ And Paulus Manutius
states that Sannazaro wrote these and five others like them

18Iu his De Portu Virginis, 111, 193, he says of one of the shep-
herds who came to worship the infant Saviour, “aequoreas carmen
deflexit ad undas ''.
