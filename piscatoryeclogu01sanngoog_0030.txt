SANNAZARO'S POPULARITY 23

silom the Works os Sannazan'us, H. Gratiae, Bapt. Amal-
t eus, eta:

I am not insensible that a late celebrated Author, in some of his
Criticisms, has found Fault with Sannazarius for choosing the Sea
for the Scene os his Eclogues, and for introducing Fishermen and
their Nets, instead of Shepherds and their Flocks; But he might
have considered, that these Poems were designed chiefly to honour
his N ative Country, which, being a Maritima Place, could not, conse· l
quently, be a proper Scene for Pastorals: BesideS, ’tis certain, that a
Plan may be contriv’d, and a Poem written upon any of the Orna-
mental Parts os Nature, and if the Incidents be justly laid, the De·
scriptions compleat, and the Characters truly drawn, the Poem must
be perfect.

Now as the Hills and Vales, the Woods and Lawna are the Scenes
of a Pastoral Poem, so the Sea and the Sea-shores are the Scenes of
these Eclogues; which, in their very Nature, differ as widely from
Pastorals, as the Two Elements from each other.

'Tis true, the Earth, array'd in all her vernal Glory‚ affords a
more agreeable Prospect; it charms the Eye with a greater Diver-
sity of Objects‚ and, consequently, gives an. Opportunity for a Poet
to entertain his Readers with a more pleasing Variety of Images;
But still the Sea, and the adjacent ShoreS, may yield Matter suffi-
cient, tho' not altogether so copious, for a Work of a different Kind;
and Whales, Delphins, Tritons, and Syrens may be introduced there ’
to as good purpose, as Goats on the Mountains, or Oxen in the Vales.
Shells and Corals and Oysters are 'as proper for a Fisherman to pre-
sent to his Mistress, as Cups and Flutes and Sheep·crooks are for a
Shepherd, and ProteuS, and Glaucus, certainly, are as much Sover·
eigns of the Sea, as Pan, and Sylvanus of the Land.

A sea-skip, therefore, well describ'd, is far from striking us with
that Horrour, which this Author would insinuate, . . .

Here, Ι will take Leave of this Gentleman, who seems to have
used a Freedom with Sannazarius, that, to say no worse of it, tres·
passes both upon Decency and good manners.

ln 1729 there appeared a further proof that Sannazaro
had not been wholly forgotten. In that year Moses Browne
published his Piscatary Eclogaes: ‘An Essay to introduce
new Rules and new Characters into Pastoral. To which is
prefixed a Discussion in Defencc of this Undertaking’.
The book was published anonymously, and the dedication
signed ‘Immerito ’. The ‘defence’ is a defence of
Browne's own eclogueS‚ not of Sannazaro’s. l quote a part
of it from the ‘second edition, corrected and enlarged'
which he printed in his Poems on Varioas Sabjects‚ Lon-
don, 1739. This shows one or two verbal changes from
the first edition. κ
