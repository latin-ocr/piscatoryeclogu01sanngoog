F RAGMENTUM.

The text of this fragment is taken from the ‘autograph’ in the
Vatican Library (Cod. Lat. 3361). It was not printed with the
other eclogues in the Naples edition of 1526, or in the Paris edition
of 1527; but it must have been circulated soon afterwards, soritis
imitated in Berardino Rota’s fourtecnth eclogue. lt is printed in
the Aldine edition of 15355 but this shows a good many variant read-
ings, and the poem is not divided, as here, between two singers.
Rota's imitation suggests that he had the poem in much the same
form as the Aldine edition gives it.

The same Vatican MS. (fol. zoV) has what looks like an early
draft of the introducti0n‚ in Sannazaro’s own hand:

Optatos iam Euplea mihi circumspice saleis
Quo liceat trepidas piscanti includeret praedas
Ac Zephyris releuare graues spirantibus aestus
Si te certa mouet velocis gratia cymbae
Tuque ades o nostri merces non parua laboris
Quam Phoebus mihi, quam doctae mea turba puellae
Conciliant. dumque ipse hamos ac retia pando
Da vela insinuans, pelagoque excurre patenti
Pars animae Puderice meae, te nam sna Nereus
Per vada, te medio Doris vocat aemula ponto
Qua late horrisonum campus strepit omnis aquarum

ln line 6 the name Triton is marked out, and Phoebus written above
it. So doctae (6) hasbeen substituted for virides, ac (7) for et, and
vocat (10) for canit. ln line 11 campus was written as the second
word, then marked out and transferred to the fourth place.

ln the Aldine edition. the second line of the Vatican fragment
does not appear at all; line 26 is completed, by the words et tempora
quattuor anni,· lines 37-42 are inserted after line 24; lines 4o·41 read:
horrida Caete· l ut saltem miseras lacerarent dentibus artus. The
Vatican MS. has an extra line (42), but it is hopelessly blurred.
