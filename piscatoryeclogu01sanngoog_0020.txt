“ACTIUS SYNCERUS” 13

di quell’ amicizia, che gli mostrava'’.⁷ But these state-
ments need not be taken any more seriously than some of the
complimentary addresses of his contemporaries—for ex·
ample, apoem by Giovanni Pardo (a reply to Eleg. i. 2) :

Acti, cui simplex peperit facundia nomen
Sinceri et vitae candida simplicitas‚⁸

or a letter from Pietro B'embo (April 13, 1505) : “ atque illa
’ in primis vel probitate vel morum'animique, si Latine satis
possum dicere, synceritate, quae quidem virtus tibi etiam
agnomen dedit, politissimus ”.⁹ Probably ‘Syncerus’ was
merely a complimentary modification of the Latinized name
‘ Sannazarius '.1⁰

As for the name ‘Actius', Volpi says that it was given
“ quod ille princeps ex Latinis bucolico poemate piscatores
de amoribus suis in acta colloquentes induxisset”.11 This
seems to be a mere inference from a passage in the second
Eclogue (45): “quandoquidem nostra cecinisti primus in
acta ”. And it can hardly be right, unless it refers to some
earlier piscatory eclogues than the five which have been
preserved. Others have connected the name with the situa-
tion of the Villa Mergillina—a villa which Sannazaro did
not possess until 1497—or with Virgil's ‘Apollo Actius’
(‘Actium's Apollo ²) Aen. viii. 70412 Possibly it was sug-
gested by the epithet in Theocritus v. 14, Πὰν tarto< (‘ Pan
of the shore’). Such a guess would at least fit in with
Sannazaro’s early devotion to pastoral, and with his early
acquaintance with Theocritus

¹⁰ So his friend Benedetto Gareth received the Academic name of
‘Chariteus’-a modification of his Latinized name ‘Garetheus' into
a form which would suggest the ‘Charites ’‚ or Graces. Then Pon-
tano could write: “ Bearunt Charites deae ministrae, E quis, o Char-
itee, nomen hauris '’. And Chariteus could say of himself: “Con
le Charite, ond' io fui Chariten '’ (E. Percopo, Le Rima di Benedetto
Garetlr, detto il C harilao, Napoli, 1892, Introd. cxcvii, and p. 424).
