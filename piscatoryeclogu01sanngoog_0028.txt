SANNAZARO’S POPULARITY 21

speak of “the admirable Latin Piscatories of that noble
Neapolitan Sanazaro'’. In the dedication oi his Sylva
ssssiggffeghineas Fletcher has an allusion to the Piscatory

Quin fixos super appendens modo retia remos
Italicus scopulos inter Piscator et undas
Parthenopae canit et piscosae Mergilinae.

And he has another in The Purple lelund, i. 13:

And now of late th’ Italian fisher-swain

sits on the shore to watch his trembling line3

There teaches rocks and prouder seas to plain

By Nesis fair and sairer Mergiline: ,
While his thinne net, upon his oars twin’d‚ etc.

Compare, especially, Ecl. iii. 10:

raraque per longos pendebant retia remos.

In the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the Eclogues of
Joannes Leochaeus Scotus,³8 Sannazaro is still regarded as
a pioneer—-though Leochaeus himself knew, and imitated,
the twenty-first Idyl of Theocritus³⁰ This Scottish poet
has twenty eclogues, divided into four groups (‘ bucolicae ',
‘ piscatoriae ', ‘nauticae ', and ‘ampelicae’ sive ‘vinitoriae ’)‚
and he claims some credit for their variety: “namque‚ ut
Bucolica excipias in quibus non pauci: quis oro praeter
Suuazarium Piscatorias Eclogas: quis praeter Hugouem
Grotium Nauticus tentavit? ‘⁰ et illius (quod dolori maximo
esse possit) ecquid praeter unicum Nauticum exstat Idyl-

³⁸ Musae Priores, sive Poematum Pars Prior, Londini, 1620.
³⁹ ln his fourth ‘ecloga piscatoria ’, Thaumasto.

⁴⁰Piscatory eclogues had been written by Berardino Rota, Ber-
nardo Tasso, Bernardino Baldi‚ CamoenS, Belleau, and others. In his
Myrtilus, sive Idyllium Numicum, Grotius professed to be playing
the partos a pioneer: “Prima mihi, sylvis et amoeno sonte relicto, l
fistula ad Oceani fluctus etad aequora venit ’'; but nautical eclogues
had already been written by Lorenzo Gambara. Grotius’ poem is an
imitation of Theocritus (111, 6-7, 21·27, 37-393 xx, 19-32; xxr, 8-12).
And it is itself paraphrased in Sarasin’s eclogue, M yrtil, ou le Nauton-
nter.
