“ACTIUS SYNCERUS’'

His Academic name was ’1Αο trus Syncerus, The mean·
ing of this name is obscure, but it is certain that he received
it, or assumed it, quite early' in his lit terary career—as early,
at least, as 1481.8 Paulus Jovius sayst that he took itat tthe
suggestion of Pontano: ‘¹ cum praeclarum fecundi atque
felicis ingenii specimen daret, repudiato avito gentilitioque
nomine, Actius Syncerus appellari voluit, adhortante Pon-
tuno, qui Ioviani cognomen amicorum imitatione desum-

Rosalba, Le Egloglre Percntarie di J. Sannaaaro, Napoli, 1908, p. 41).
In the Arcadia, a work composed “uela prima adolescentia del
poeta’', he refers to himself as ι81111110 '. And in two 01 his earlier
poems, Eleg. 1, 10, 23, and 11, 7, 71, he calls himself ‘Actius ’.
