IMI TA TIONS

Since he is gone, I’ll fetch him to my Arms

By sacred Spells, and force of Magick Charms.
Search in the Slime, you’ll find the Cramp-fish there,
That chilling stops whatever swims too near:

Yon’ll find the Fish that stays the labouring Ship,
Tho’ ruffling Winds drive o’er the noisy De'ep:

So Phorbas, while from me he perjur’d flies,

Is struck benumb’d, and fix'd with strange Surprise,

with Ecl. v. 55-58. 'The twelfth poem reports a dialogue

between two fishermcn, and the last two (xiii, xiv) contain ·

some curious information about fishcs. .
The Piscatory Eclogues of· Moses Browne were first pub-

lished (London, 1729) with the sub-title “an Essay to
introduce new Rules and new Characters into Pastoral”.
They are not a mere par'aphrase or a slavish imitation of
Sannazaro’s poems; indeed, their author was “flatter'd to
believe his Endeavours would meet with a more favourable
Acceptance, if Sanazarius had never wrote his Sea-
Eclogues ”. still, the second, The N octurnol, may remind
the reader of Sannazaro’s second ; and ‘Renock' is a sort
of eighteenth-century ‘ Lycon ἐ

Coy Maid! lost lovely Sweet! ah, you can rest,
While I still wake with cruel Cares opprest,
Blest Pow’r of Sleep! her Eye·lids gently close,
Melt her soit Dreams with Renock's dying Woes!

The scene of the third, The Sea Swoins, may recall San-
nazaro's third. “A Company of Fishers, forc’d in their
Boats from Sea, by bad Weather‚ take Harbour up a shady
Stream, where they divert and refresh themselves ’'. The
poem begins:

By a close Creek, with shelt’ring Rocks confin’d,
While the Seas echo’d to the vexing wind,

Old Chromis in his dancing Boat withdraw,

To mix in Pastimes with the harbour'd C rew.

Here while their Oars the idle N ets snstain

(Drove from their Labonrs on the madding Main)
The F ishar-Sire, in Skill experienc’d long,

The Y ouths now challenge for his promis’d Sangam

⁶1Quoted from Poemr on Various Subjects, London, 1739. Here
this eologue stands fourth in the series, and a few verbal changes

have been made.
