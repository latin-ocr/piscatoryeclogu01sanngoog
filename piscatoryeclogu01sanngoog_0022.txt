Dm OF THE LATIN ECLOGUES 15

before he went to France (1501): “quas tamen decem
scripserat, sed e Gallia reversus has tantum quas emisimus
et fragmentum . . invenit ”2⁰ But neither of these state-
ments can be strictly true. The third and fourth Eclogues
refer respectively to the exile of Federico Il (1501) and to
his death (1504). And there is nothing in the remaining
three to show that they were written at an earlier date. The
fifth should probably be set later than 1504, because of its
dedication to Cassandra Marchese.¹⁷ And lines 113-115
seem to allude to the poet’s own exile in France. A passage
in the second (41-45) has been held to prove that Sannazaro
wrote piscatory eclogues‚ and probably this one, before the
death of Pontano (1503).18 But even if ‘Lycon' here
means Sannazaro, it cannot be inferred that ‘Melisaeus'
( Pontano) was still alive when the poem was written. And
in any case the passage is too much like the corresponding
passage in Virgil’s second Eclogue (36-38) to be made the
basis of any serious argument.

Sannazaro himself indicates that they were written after
he had berun his De Portu virginum ln a sketch of his

own life, Eleg. iii. 2, he writes (45-58):

mox maiora vocant me numina: scilicet alti
incessere animum sacra verenda Dei . . .
nec minus haec inter piscandi concitus egit
ardor in aequoreos mittere lina sinus, etc.

And his friend Summonte could spealr of them in 1507 as
“novas illas piscatorio genere eclogas ''‚ apparently in con-
trast with certain'other poems “quibus iunior lusit ''.²⁰
