SANNAZARO'S POPULARITY 25

is frequently lost. They have, therefore, no opportunity of tracing
in their own thoughts the descriptions of winding shores and calm
bays, nor can look on the poem in which they are mentioned with
other sensation than on a sea chart, or the metrical geography of
Dionysius.

This defect Sannazarius was hindered from perceiving, by writing
in a learned language to readers generally acquainted with the
works of nature; but it' he had made his attempt in any vulgar
tongue, he would soon have discovered how vainly he had endeav-
oured to make that loved, which was not understood.

All this is very impressive‚ and very final; but it really
has very little to do with what Sannazaro actually wrote.
For in these piscatory eclogues there is no more about the
sunrise at sea, or the fish sporting in the shallows or the
complaint of a nymph for a drowned lover, than there isin
Virgil himself.

In 1783 an Edinburgh scholar, Hugh Blair, had some-

thing to say of Sannazam, Lectores on Rhetoric aad Bellen
Lettres, xxxix:

The modern writers of pastorals have, generally, contented them·
selves with copying, or imitating, the descriptione and sentiments of
the ancient poets. Sannazarius indeed, a famous Latin poet, in the
age of Leo X, attempted a bold innovation. He composed Piscatory
EclogueS, changing the scene from woods to the sea, and from the
life of shepherds to that of fishermen. But the innovation was so ¹
unhappy, that he has gained no followers. For the life of fishermen
is, obviously, much more hard and toilsome than that of shepherds,
and presents to the fancy much less agreeable images. Flocks, and
trees, and flowers‚ are objects of greater beauty, and more generally
relished by men, thau fishes and marine productiona

Apparently Blair was much more familiar with the opin-
ions of Johnson and F ontenelle than with the Latin original.
still, his Lectores were used as a text-book far into the
next century, and probably very few of his readers ever

⁸ questioned his authority, or read the poems for themselves

Another bit of traditional criticism which is often quoted
comes from William Roscoe’s Life aad Pontificnte of Leo
the Tentlz (1805). He is speaking of Sannazaro’s Latin
¹ poems:

Of these the eclogues possess the meritos having exhibited a novel
species of composition, in adapting the language of poetry to the
characters and occupations of fishermen; and this tasl< he has exe·
